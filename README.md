GUI Introduction-
--> GUI stands for Graphical User Interface, and refers to 
computer programs that provide a visual means for 
users to interact with an underlying application or 
system. For example, the GUIs on our mobile phones 
allow us to interact with different functions through the 
display, which we can touch, tap, and swipe on.
Python offers multiple options for developing GUI 
(Graphical User Interface).

--> Out of all the GUI methods, tkinter is the most commonly used method. 
It is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit 
shipped with Python. Python with tkinter is the fastest 
and easiest way to create the GUI applications. 
Creating a GUI using tkinter is an easy task.

Creating Gui screen-
• To create a gui screen we need to follow some steps that we can see below:.
• Importing the tkinter library.
• Then Initialize the root window
• Then add number of widgets like label
 ,button etc.
• Then pack the widget
• Starting the event looping.

Different Methods used are-
• Here in the first line we import everything from the tkinter module. We create a root window in the second
line. In the third line we specify the root and what labels we are deciding to put into the root. Here it is just
a text. Then to pack the label to the window we use w.pack(). To start the execution with the event
looping, we use root.mainloop()
• Geometry manager or Layout manager of tkinter uses
• pack() method
• grid() method
• place() method
Pack- The pack() method in geometry manager organizes and place the widgets in blocks before putting 
them in the parent widget.
Fill- Fill is used to specify if it takes the space allocated to it or to change if extra space is allocated.
 Fill method used X and Y attribute to set the space in window.
Grid-This separates the parent widget into a table like structure with rows and columns in them with each part
contributed to a widget.Grid method used row and column attribute to set the widget in window.

Button, methods & Variables-
● Button is a standard widget in python tkinter. If the button is clicked, some mouse action is started.
● They can also contain text and images like labels.
● While labels can display text in various fonts, a button can only display text in a single font.
● The text of a button can span more than one line.
● It contain the attribute like text which help to set text in button.
● With the help of width attribute ,button size can be change.
● With the help of command attribute you can add functionality in button.
Tkinter Variables
There are 4 type of tkinter variable as mentioned in below lines:
BooleanVar()-It used to store Binary values.
StringVar()-It used to store string values.
IntVar()-It used to store integer values.
DoubleVar()-It used to store float type values.
Methods
Geometry method can help to change the dimension of gui window.
Entry method can help to take input from user in gui screen.
Get method is used to get the data from tkinter variable


ALL THE BEST!!!!
